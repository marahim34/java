### Application class Name
public class MyFirstApp{

}

- every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.
- Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. And the class name should always start with an uppercase first letter. In our example, we named the class Main/MyFirstApp etc.

### The main method
public static void main(String[] args){

}

- Every program must contain the main() method.
- Any code inside the main() method will be executed.

## The code to be executed
example:
System.out.println("Print\n");

- System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". 
- The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
- Java does have the print() method; but the only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:


## Comments
- Single Line Comments: Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
- Multi Line Comments: Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
